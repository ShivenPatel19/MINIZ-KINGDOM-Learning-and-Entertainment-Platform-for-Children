## 🎯 **What is Miniz Kingdom?**

Miniz Kingdom offers three core interactive activities:

1. **Learn Alphabet**: Kids strike poses in front of the camera to learn letters. Correct poses trigger auditory feedback like "A for Apple" with vibrant visuals and cheerful background music.

2. **Learn Numbers**: A similar pose-based approach helps kids grasp numbers with engaging auditory and visual feedback.

3. **Mimic Famous Characters**: Kids can replicate iconic poses of characters like Hulk, Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Flash, turning learning into an adventurous journey!

## 🧑‍💻 **Implementation**

Miniz Kingdom integrates modern web technologies and machine learning to create an engaging user experience.

### **Dataset Creation**

- Custom dataset of ~600,000 data points capturing key body positions.
- Data was normalized, grouped, and used to train multiple models for accurate pose recognition.

### **Key Technologies**

- **p5.js**: Extracted 17 key body points for pose detection from each video frame.
- **ml5.js Neural Network**: Trained models to classify poses accurately across activities.
